A distinction is made between two types of polymer bitumen: elastomer bitumen (PYE) and plastomer bitumen (PYP). Data are representative for a PYE top layer bitumen waterproofing membrane used on the Swedish market. In the Nordic countries is bitumen waterproofing almost exclusively uses bitumen modified with SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene).",

    "TechnologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses": "The manufacturing is done by heating the raw materials (bitumen and copolymers) to a specific temperature and mixing them. After this the mix is applied to the reinforcing structure (polyester or glass fibre). The resulting sheet is cooled and then faced with mineral granules. The bitumen is generally delivered as hot from the petroleum refinery to the manufacturing site, where it’s heated further. Significant differences arise mainly from the amounts of bitumen and the SBS used in the products. As SBS has a large share of emission, using alternative copolymers to modify the bitumen would also change the GWP-GHG A1-3 value.",

The most essential issues that affect the climate impact of aluminium products are the scrab content, the energy efficiency of the manufacturing process and the GHGs of the energy sources used. Compared to the production of primary aluminium, secondary aluminium ingot requires roughly 5 % of the original energy consumption . All aluminium products can be recycled after use. Aluminium losses in melting are low, roughly 3%. The thermal energy from natural gas used to melt aluminium scrap in many recycling facilities contributes to the consumption of about 52% of the total non-renewable energy consumption for secondary ingot production. Correspondingly, natural gas contributes 48% of GWP-GHG A1-3. The manufacturing of primary aluminium ingot includes bauxite mining, alumina refining, electrolysis (including anode production and smelting), and primary ingot casting.

    "GeneralComment": "The most essential issues that affect the climate impact of aluminium products are the scrab content, the energy efficiency of the manufacturing process and the GHGs of the energy sources used. Compared to the production of primary aluminium, secondary aluminium ingot requires roughly 5 % of the original energy consumption . All aluminium products can be recycled after use. Aluminium losses in melting are low, roughly 3%. The thermal energy from natural gas used to melt aluminium scrap in many recycling facilities contributes to the consumption of about 52% of the total non-renewable energy consumption for secondary ingot production. Correspondingly, natural gas contributes 48% of GWP-GHG A1-3. The manufacturing of primary aluminium ingot includes bauxite mining, alumina refining, electrolysis (including anode production and smelting), and primary ingot casting.

Since their natural concentrations are much lower, the ore needs careful treatment to maximize recovery yields. Modern mining techniques require less energy than in the past, making the recovery of small amounts of metal more viable. The first stage ore extraction and processing are the main contributors to GWP-GHG A1-3. The metal produced from ores and concentrates is referred to as primary copper production. Metal can also be produced by recycling the scrap generated during the operations of the downstream value chain, as well as from end-of-life products.",
